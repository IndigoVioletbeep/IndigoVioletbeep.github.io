<p class="textBlog"> COVID-19 has made the entire country panic. Supermarkets stock is rapidly dissapearing and people are stockpiling as much as they can. But no need to worry! If people just <i> dont </i> stockpile and the shops will keep up. The problem is, currently, that shops have got to try and keep up with a lot more demand, that they simply dont have the supply for! </p>

<p class="textBlog"> The problems with this, including lack of supply to consumers, is that some people have LOTS of food, and others have barely any. If people just stopped buying en masse then people would be able to eat food sustainably. We're all in this crisis together. Buy responsibly and we'll get through this before anyone knows it. </p>
