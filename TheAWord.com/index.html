<li class="news"> Entry 2. Its now 24/03/20. I have posted (1) new blog, and im actually impressed with how much work i did on this website. Considering i programmed the bulk of it when i had the flu. I like it, still. May give it a bit of a facelift on the colours as right now, its grey, black and white. Pretty dull.</li>
<br>
<li class="news"> Its about a week or two since I started programming this website, It's the 28th of December 2019, welcome to the first entry in the news feed! </li>
