<h1 align="center" class="titleBlog"><b> <u> The beauty of a story is not what is written, but what comes after. </u> </b> </h1>

<p class="textBlog">I have watched, read and heard a lot in my life. With the majority of all of those experiences (that count) being stories. Tales that whisk me away for hours or days or weeks, but tales that will all come to an end. It seems to be a constant cycle of falling in love with story experiences and then feeling a vague emptiness afterward, longing for more. But as the title suggests, I feel that’s where the beauty comes from. That’s what makes these stories truly amazing to me. The thought of what comes after. </p>

<p class="textBlog">	I’m a huge romance fan, so you can see how the afterthoughts to those stories could be incredible, and they are one of the only things to make my heartache, embarrassingly so. I’ve only ever once encountered a story that could tell the whole life of a romance protagonists’ experiences and truly fulfill me, and that was a Wattpad story of which I cannot remember the name. Yet I’ve come to realize that maybe an incomplete story is the best, or the most beautiful? In the incomplete stories, you get to perceive it ending truly as you wish. Directly after watching something your imagination creates the most fulfilling ending for you, and you feel a glimpse of hope. Now the trick is to grab hold of that and do some thinking about what would actually happen (according to you). If you feel the impulse to suddenly write something or draw or whatever, do it. Because you might be able to feel total satisfaction from the story if you add a little bit of yourself to it. </p>

<p class="textBlog">	It’s not that I’m saying writers are doing a bad job. Its just that most romantic films i’ve watched end at the beginning, and you are left to speculate everything else. This used to make me upset, knowing i would never truly know. But now I realize that the point (and the beauty) of these stories is the not-knowing, the mystery. And now I love it!</p>

<p class="textBlog">	So, in conclusion. Stories are beautiful, but they are not beautiful only because of what is written, but all of the things that come after it is written aswell.</p>
